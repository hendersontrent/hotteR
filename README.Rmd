# hotteR

Hottest 100 Countdown Analysis Engine in R.

## Installation

You can install `hotteR` from GitHub by running the following:

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("hendersontrent/hotteR")
```

## get_plays()

You can automatically pull summed counts of plays from the @triplejplays Twitter account using the `get_plays()` one-line function. The data is cleaned, processed, and summed behind the scenes, leaving you more time to focus on analysis and data visualisation.

```{r message = FALSE}
library(hotteR)

play_data <- get_plays(year = 2020)
```
