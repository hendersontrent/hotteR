Hottest 100 Countdown and Triple J Analysis in R.

## Installation

You can install `hotteR` from GitHub by running the following:

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("hendersontrent/hotteR")
```

## Motivation

Previous analysis by [Orbisant Analytics](https://www.orbisantanalytics.com/hottest-100) highlighted interesting relationships in the 2019 Triple J Hottest 100 Countdown. This was a fairly discrete piece of analysis, and given the amount of manual work involved, motivated a more scalable and programmatic approach to enable future analysis.

## Core functions

### get_countdowns()

You can webscrape all prior Hottest 100 Countdown results (including Hottest 100 of the decade) using `get_countdowns()`.

```{r message = FALSE, eval = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(hotteR)
countdown_data <- get_countdowns()
```

### historical_countdowns

A full dataset of all previous Hottest 100 Countdowns available to-date comes ready with the package. It has columns for rank, year, artist name, song name, and artist nationality.

```{r message = FALSE, eval = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(hotteR)
historical_countdowns
```

### do_countdown_analysis()

You can automatically get some high level analysis and data visualisations for data retrieved from `get_countdowns()` or `historical_countdowns` using `do_countdown_analysis()`.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.keep = TRUE}
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
library(janitor)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)
library(hotteR)

do_countdown_analysis(historical_countdowns)
```

### get_plays()

You can automatically pull summed counts of plays from the @triplejplays Twitter account using the `get_plays()` one-line function. The data is cleaned, processed, and summed behind the scenes, leaving you more time to focus on analysis and data visualisation.

```{r message = FALSE, eval = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(hotteR)
play_data <- get_plays(year = 2020)
```

### do_plays_analysis()

You can automatically get some high level analysis and data visualisations for data retrieved from `get_plays()` using `do_plays_analysis()`.

```{r message = FALSE, eval = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(hotteR)
play_data <- get_plays(year = 2020)
do_plays_analysis(the_plays)
```

### theme_hotteR

As well as data scraping and analysis functions, `hotteR` also provides a distinct and striking contrasting colour palette that is called and used by default when the package is loaded.

```{r message = FALSE}
library(scales)
scales::show_col(hotteR:::hotteR_palette)
```
