Hottest 100 Countdown and Triple J Plays Webscraping and Analysis in R

## Installation

You can install the development version of `hotteR` from GitHub by running the following:

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("hendersontrent/hotteR")
```

## Motivation

Previous analysis by [Orbisant Analytics](https://www.orbisantanalytics.com/hottest-100) highlighted interesting relationships in the 2019 Triple J Hottest 100 Countdown. This was a fairly discrete piece of analysis, and given the amount of manual work involved, motivated a more scalable and programmatic approach to enable future analysis. An example of analysis that is automated by the package includes the matrix of plots presented below.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.keep = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
library(hotteR)

do_countdown_analysis(historical_countdowns)
```

## Citation

You can cite `hotteR` using the following:

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
citation("hotteR")
```
