Hottest 100 Countdown and Triple J Analysis in R.

## Installation

You can install `hotteR` from GitHub by running the following:

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("hendersontrent/hotteR")
```

## Motivation

Previous analysis by [Orbisant Analytics](https://www.orbisantanalytics.com/hottest-100) highlighted interesting relationships in the 2019 Triple J Hottest 100 Countdown. This was a fairly discrete piece of analysis, and given the amount of manual work involved, motivated a more scalable and programmatic approach to enable future analysis.

## Core functions

### get_countdowns()

You can webscrape all prior Hottest 100 Countdown results (including Hottest 100 of the decade) using `get_countdowns()`.

```{r message = FALSE, eval = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(hotteR)

countdown_data <- get_countdowns()
```

### historical_countdowns

A full dataset of all previous Hottest 100 Countdowns available to-date comes ready with the package. It has columns for rank, year, artist name, song name, and artist nationality.

```{r message = FALSE, eval = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(hotteR)

historical_countdowns
```

### do_countdown_analysis()

You can automatically get some high level analysis and data visualisations for data retrieved from `get_countdowns()` or `historical_countdowns` using `do_countdown_analysis()`.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.keep = TRUE}
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
library(janitor)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
library(ggpubr)
library(hotteR)

do_countdown_analysis(historical_countdowns)
```

### get_plays()

You can automatically pull summed counts of plays from the @triplejplays Twitter account using the `get_plays()` one-line function. The data is cleaned, processed, and summed behind the scenes, leaving you more time to focus on analysis and data visualisation.

```{r message = FALSE, eval = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
play_data <- get_plays(year = 2020)
```

### do_plays_analysis()

You can automatically get some high level analysis and data visualisations for data retrieved from `get_plays()` using `do_plays_analysis()`.

```{r message = FALSE, eval = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
play_data <- get_plays(year = 2020)
do_plays_analysis(the_plays)
```

### calculate_priors()

Bayesian functionality is built into the package given the annually updating nature of the Hottest 100 Countdown. All Bayesian functions have been coded in the probabilistic programming language `Stan` and abstracted away into a one line R function for ease of use. The first function is `calculate_priors()` which computes a mean, standard deviation (SD), 2.5% credible interval lower bound and 97.5% credible interval upper bound (together forming a 95% credible interval) for an ordinal logistic regression model of quartile placement in the Hottest 100. The mean and SD calculated by this function can be used as informative priors in a predictive model. This function takes one of two timescales as an argument:

* "Last Decade"
* "All Time"

```{r message = FALSE, eval = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(rstan)

priors <- calculate_priors(timescale = "All Time")
```

### plot_priors()

As well as the formal value calculation of priors, a calculation and distribution visualisation function is also included as `plot_priors()`. This function produces a density plot of the coefficient for the nationality predictor variable. This function takes one of two timescales as an argument:

* "Last Decade"
* "All Time"

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, results = 'hide', fig.keep = TRUE}
plot_prior(timescale = "All Time")
```

### plot_probabilities()

You can automatically produce density plots of probability of belongingness by Hottest 100 Countdown quartile and nationality with `plot_probabilities()`. This function takes one of two timescales as an argument:

* "Last Decade"
* "All Time"

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.keep = TRUE}
plot_probabilities(timescale = "Last Decade")
```

### plot_quartile_area()

You can automatically produce time series area plots by quartile and nationality using `plot_quartile_area()`:

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.keep = TRUE}
plot_quartile_area()
```

### theme_hotteR()

As well as data scraping and analysis functions, `hotteR` also provides a distinct and striking contrasting colour palette that is called and used by default when the package is loaded.

```{r message = FALSE}
scales::show_col(hotteR:::hotteR_palette)
```
